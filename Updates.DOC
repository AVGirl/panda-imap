		      C-Client Revision History

Note: Dates in this revision history indicate when the work was completed.

 1 June 1992	Creation.  Changes prior to this were not noted.

 1 June 1992	[tenex.c] Fixed tenex driver so that copying messages to an
		open mailbox does not hang.  Still need to have protection
		against multiple simultaneous attempts to append in this
		format.

 2 June 1992	[bezerk.c, imap2.c, mail.c/h, mh.c, mtest.c, news.c, tenex.c]
		Changed elt internal dates to be stored as numeric fields
		instead of strings.

 2 June 1992	[mail.c/h, mh.h, news.h, os_???.c] Moved months array from
		osdep stuff into main module.

 3 June 1992	[imap2.c] Repaired small memory leaks in IMAP MIME support.

 3 June 1992	[os_hpp.c/h] Emulate gethostid () on HP/UX.

 3 June 1992	[imapd.c, ms.c, InfoPanel.nib, MBoxWindow.m, ReadWindow.m,
		 ReplyWindow.m, Utilities.m] Updated c-client bundled tools
		to use new internal date strategy.

 4 June 1992	[rfc822.c] Fixed gruesome bogosity in rfc822_8bit.

 7 June 1992	[bezerk.c/h, tenex.c/h, mh.c/h, news.c/h] Removed `date'
		per-message local driver variables; use the numeric dates
		stored in the elt internal date instead.

 8 June 1992	[mail.c/h] Made it portable to DOS and Mac once again.

 8 June 1992	[rfc822.c] Fixed a couple of bugs in quoted-printable encoding.
		It seems that people are actually trying to use the QP support!

 8 June 1992	[bezerk.c/h, dummy.c/h, imap2.c/h, mail.c/h, mbox.c, mh.c/h,
		 mtest.c, news.c/h, tenex.c/h] Created the concept of `long'
		vs. `short' caching.  Modified all drivers to know about the
		new mechanism.  The mail_fetchenvelope() function is now
		history, and is replaced by mail_fetchstructure() which has a
		new argument, a pointer to a destination body pointer.

 9 June 1992	[MBoxWindow.m, ReadWindow.m, ReplyWindow.m/h] Update
		MailManager to know about long elt's.

 9 June 1992	[bezerk.c, imap2.c, mh.c, news.c, tenex.c] Implement short
		cache support in all drivers.

10 June 1992	[mail.c/h, tenex.c] Change API for mail_open() so that the
		third argument (formerly debug) is now an options bitmask.
		The options are defined in mail.h

10 June 1992	[mtest.c, ms.c, imapd.c, MailManager.m] Update main programs
		to know about new mail_open() API.

11 June 1992	[bezerk.c, imap2.c, mh.c, news.c, tenex.c] Fix bug in returning
		bodies from mail_fetchstructure().

16 June 1992	[bezerk.c, imap2.c, mail.c/h, tenex.c] Put all cache management
		under the control of a single function which can be overridden
		by the main program.

16 June 1992	[os_ptx.c] Fix rimap on PTX.

17 June 1992	[ipop3d.c] Fix missing response in POP3 TOP command.

17 June 1992	[bezerk.c, tenex.c] Implement read only open in local drivers.

18 June 1992	[smtp.h] Remove prototype for smtp_parse_address().

18 June 1992	[Internals.DOC] Update and expand API document.

24 June 1992	[dawz.c/h] Started work on DOS local file driver.  Updates to
		it won't be documented until first release.

25 June 1992	[rfc822.c] Fixed crash caused by Content-Type with a subtype
		delimiter but no subtype.

25 June 1992	[imap2.c] Fix bug parsing body contents with short caches.

 1 July 1992	[rfc822.c] Fixed yet another bug in quoted-printable encoding.

 6 July 1992	[*dbw*, *dpc*] More changes to B&W and PC-TCP stuff from Ken
		Bobey.

 8 July 1992	[os_???.c] Fixed handling of CR's in tcp_getline().

12 July 1992	[mail.h] Added data1 and data2 to elt.

12 July 1992	[os_???.h, bezerk.c, dummy.c, mbox.c, mh.c, news.c, tenex.c]
		Move include of sys/uio.h to osdep.h files because not all
		Unix systems have it.

12 July 1992	[os_???.c/h, bezerk.c] New lockname() osdep routine to make a
		status lock file instead of being wired into bezerk.c code.

12 July 1992	[os_???.c/h, bezerk.c] NFSKLUDGE switch controls the NFS
		kludge, yet another concession for SCO cretinism.

14 July 1992	[os_sco.c/h, makefile.sco] More updates to SCO sources.

15 July 1992	[mail.c, imap2.c/h, bezerk.c, mh.c, news.c, tenex.c] Make
		cache flushing when recycling a stream be the driver's
		responsibility.  imap2 now uses the new data1/data2 elt words
		to hold its string cache pointers.

15 July 1992	[non-ANSI os_???.c] Fix lockname() definitions.

16 July 1992	[os_???.c/h] Yet another episode in the parsing of lines from
		TCP.  Fix lockname() definitions in non-ANSI sources again.

16 July 1992	[bezerk.c/h, mbox.c] Delete fname local stream variable.  Fix
		lock file name.

19 July 1992	[makefile.sco, os_sco.c] Yet more random updates to SCO stuff.

21 July 1992	[os_???.c/h, bezerk.c, dummy.c, imap2.c, mail.c, mbox.c, mh.c,
		 misc.c, mtest.c, news.c, nntp.c, smtp.c, tenex.c] Shuffled
		includes some more.  <sys/types.h> is now moved to the osdep
		file so the <sys/uio.h> includes work.  Deleted some UNIX
		dependent code.

21 July 1992	[os_???.c/h, imapd.c, ipop?d.c] Added argc and argv as
		arguments to server_login() for SCO's benefit.  What a
		troublesome operating system!

21 July 1992	[mtest.c] Put dawz hooks into mtest.

22 July 1992	[dawz.c/h] First release of dawz local file driver for DOS.
		Is presently missing MIME and text search capability, also does
		not support user keywords (although some hooks are there).

22 July 1992	[makefile.d??] Added dawz driver to DOS makefiles.

22 July 1992	[bezerk.c, imap2.c, mail.c, tenex.c] Fixed bogus references to
		mm_cache() function instead of (*mailcache) ().

23 July 1992	[os_sco.c/h] More SCO madness (the last time?).

23 July 1992	[imap2.c] Fixed rimapd behavior when the login is OK but there
		is no /etc/rimapd.

23 July 1992	[bezerk.c/h, mbox.c] Fix mbox behavior when bezerk mailbox is
		gubbish.

12 August 1992	[os_ptx.c/h, mh.c, news.c] Fixes for PTX.

13 August 1992	[os_ptx.c, news.c] More fixes for PTX.

20 August 1992	[mail.c, imap2.c] Fix missing cast of lelt and elt from
		mailcache function.

20 August 1992	[mh.c, news.c] PTX fixes of 13 August broke DYNIX.

31 August 1992	[rfc822.c] Fix comment-as-name handling when host is missing
		(thanks LGL!).

31 August 1992	[ReadWindow.nib, SendWindow.nib] Make EasyMail build again (it
		had been broken since the EMACS editing stuff was added).

9 September 1992[bezerk.h/c] Fixed bad file closing bug when recycling a
		bezerk stream.
