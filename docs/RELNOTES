imap-4.2 is a production release of the imap-4.1 beta toolkit, distributed
with Pine 4.01.  This is the only version of imap-4.2 which will be released.
imap-4.3 is expected to be another beta toolkit.

This version supports IMAP4rev1 (RFC 2060).  There are major internal and
external changes from the IMAP2bis version (e.g. imap-3.6, distributed with
Pine 3.9x).  It is extremely unlikely that a program written for the IMAP2bis
verion will build with this version without modifications.  Drivers written
for the IMAP2bis version will definitely need to be rewritten.

Most notable operational changes from imap-3.x:
 . Kerberos V5 is supported through the GSSAPI on UNIX.  To enable Kerberos V5,
    add "gss" to the EXTRAAUTHENTICATORS list in the top-level Makefile and
     rebuild.  You may also need to edit the GSSAPI directory paths in the
     ../src/osdep/unix/Makefile
 . The mbox driver is now enabled by default.  If the file "mbox" exists on
    the user's home directory and is in UNIX mailbox format, then when INBOX
    is opened this file will be selected as INBOX instead of the mail spool
    file.  Messages will be automatically transferred from the mail spool file
    into the mbox file
   To disable this behavior, delete "mbox" from the EXTRADRIVERS list in the
    top-level Makefile and rebuild
 . IMAP4rev1 protocol is now supported.  The UNIX format support now maintains
    unique identifiers (UIDs) and keyword flags for each message, and keeps an
    invisible message at the start of the file which contains the UID base
    information and a list of assigned keywords.  There is no way to disable
    this behavior, since it would disable IMAP4rev1 support.  This message may
    show up if you access the mailbox as a file using older mail software (e.g.
    Pine 3.9x).  It is invisible with IMAP or POP access, or with access as a
    file using Pine 4.00
 . Support for additional mailbox formats
 . No longer keeps entire mailbox in memory for UNIX format files
 . Multilingual searching of the following charsets are supported:
	US-ASCII, UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4,
	ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6, ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9,
	ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-15,
	ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-KR, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-JP-1, ISO-2022-JP-2,
	GB2312 (alias CN-GB), CN-GB-12345, BIG5 (alias CN-BIG5),
	EUC-JP, EUC-KR, Shift_JIS,
	KOI8-R, KOI8-U (alias KOI8-RU), TIS-620, VISCII.
   All ISO-2022-?? charsets are treated identically, and support ASCII,
    JIS Roman, hankaku katakana, ISO-8859-[1 - 10], TIS, GB 2312, JIS X 0208,
    JIS X 0212, KSC 5601, and planes 1 and 2 of CNS 11643.
   EUC-JP includes support for JIS X 0212 and hankaku katakana
 . Fast sorting including IMAP server-based sort
 . Fast ordered-subject threading including IMAP server-based threading


Most notable programmer/external changes from imap-3.x:
 . Additional ports
 . New directory orientation, no separate non-ANSI sources
 . New local file formats mbx and mx
 . The bezerk driver has been retired, and replaced with the new unix driver
    which does not keep a snapshot in memory
 . Many new added ports including NT (Win32 client, NT server)
 . Many new data access functions
 . Numerous interface changes; look at the .h files for details
 . There are no known security problems in this version
 . If you ignored the warnings and used the evil configuration file, its name
    and contents have changed incompatibly
